# Python-Companion-to-ISLR
I am a student of Python and Machine Learning.  While reading the classic *Introduction to Statistical Learning*, I found it beneficial to reproduce the book's graphs, tables, and labs in Python.  I also used this opportunity to create a literate documente using Org mode in Emacs.

I hope you will find this project useful.  You are welcome to send me comments and feedback on any aspect of this project (e.g., Python code; use of Org mode and emacs; organization of code, data, and text).

For Python, my Emacs setup uses elpy package with jupyter shell interpreter.  For R, my emacs setup uses ESS package.
