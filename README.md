# Python-Companion-to-ISLR
 While reading the classic [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), I found it beneficial to reproduce the book's graphs, tables, and labs in Python.  I also used this opportunity to create a literate document using Org mode in Emacs.

I hope you will find this project useful.  You are welcome to send me comments and feedback on any aspect of this project (e.g., Python code; use of Org mode and emacs; organization of code, data, and text).
