* Introduction

Figure [[fig:introFig1]] shows graphs of Wage versus three variables.

#+NAME: fig:introFig1
#+CAPTION: =Wage= data, which contains income survey information for males from the central Atlantic region of the United States.  Left: =wage= as a function of =age=.  On average, =wage= increases with =age= until about 60 years of age, at which point it begins to decline.  Center: =wage= as a function of =year=.  There is a slow but steady increase of approximately $10,000 in the average =wage= between 2003 and 2009.  Right: Boxplots displaying =wage= as a function of =education=, with 1 indicating the lowest level (no highschool diploma) and 5 the highest level (an advanced graduate degree).  On average, =wage= increases with the level of =education=.

Figure [[fig:introFig2]] shows boxplots of previous days' percentage changes in S&P
500 grouped according to today's change Up or Down. 

#+NAME: fig1_2plot

  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('Agg')
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import sys

  import SmarketPlot
  plt.savefig(fname)
  return fname
#+END_SRC


#+NAME: fig:introFig2
#+CAPTION: Left: Boxplots of the previous day's percentage change in the S&P 500 index for the days for which the market increased or decreased, obtained from the =Smarket= data.  Center and Right: Same as left panel, but the percentage changes for two and three days previous are shown.

* Statistical Learning

Figure [[fig:statLearnFig1]] shows scatter plots of =Sales= versus =TV=, =Radio=,
and =Newspaper= advertising.  In each panel, the figure also include an OLS
regression line.

  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('Agg')
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import sys
  sys.path.append('./code/chap2/')

  import salesPlot
  plt.savefig(fname)
  return fname
#+END_SRC


#+NAME: fig:statLearnFig1
#+CAPTION: The =Advertising= data set.
