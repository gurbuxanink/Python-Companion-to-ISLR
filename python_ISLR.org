#+NAME: fig:introFig1
#+CAPTION: =Wage= data, which contains income survey information for males from the central Atlantic region of the United States.  Left: =wage= as a function of =age=.  On average, =wage= increases with =age= until about 60 years of age, at which point it begins to decline.  Center: =wage= as a function of =year=.  There is a slow but steady increase of approximately $10,000 in the average =wage= between 2003 and 2009.  Right: Boxplots displaying =wage= as a function of =education=, with 1 indicating the lowest level (no highschool diploma) and 5 the highest level (an advanced graduate degree).  On average, =wage= increases with the level of =education=.
