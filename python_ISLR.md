# Introduction

Figure [2](#org58645a4) shows graphs of Wage versus three variables. 

![img](figures/fig1_1.png "`Wage` data, which contains income survey information for males from the central Atlantic region of the United States.  Left: `wage` as a function of `age`.  On average, `wage` increases with `age` until about 60 years of age, at which point it begins to decline.  Center: `wage` as a function of `year`.  There is a slow but steady increase of approximately $10,000 in the average `wage` between 2003 and 2009.  Right: Boxplots displaying `wage` as a function of `education`, with 1 indicating the lowest level (no highschool diploma) and 5 the highest level (an advanced graduate degree).  On average, `wage` increases with the level of `education`.")

Figure [4](#org780cc31) shows boxplots of previous days' percentage changes in S&P
500 grouped according to today's change Up or Down. 

![img](figures/fig1_2.png "Left: Boxplots of the previous day's percentage change in the S&P 500 index for the days for which the market increased or decreased, obtained from the `Smarket` data.  Center and Right: Same as left panel, but the percentage changes for two and three days previous are shown.")
