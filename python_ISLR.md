# Introduction

Using an `R` code block, we will save `Wage` data as a csv file.

Now we can read `Wage` data in `python` and plot graphs. Figure [3](#orgf2dee2c) shows
graphs of Wage versus three variables. 

![img](figures/fig1_1.png "`Wage` data, which contains income survey information for males from the central Atlantic region of the United States.  Left: `wage` as a function of `age`.  On average, `wage` increases with `age` until about 60 years of age, at which point it begins to decline.  Center: `wage` as a function of `year`.  There is a slow but steady increase of approximately \\$10,000 in the average `wage` between 2003 and 2009.  Right: Boxplots displaying `wage` as a function of `education`, with 1 indicating the lowest level (no highschool diploma) and 5 the highest level (an advanced graduate degree).  On average, `wage` increases with the level of `education`.")
